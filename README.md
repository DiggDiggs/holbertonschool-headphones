# Holberton Headphones Project 2023

*Implement a design from scratch*

## Description

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

The project does not have any restrictions, other than:
* No outside CSS frameworks (ex. Bootstrap)
* No Javascript

## Project Advice
* Start with these strong foundations:
	-   reset CSS styling
	-   use variables
	-   simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
	-   avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
	-   simple HTML structure -  `div`  containers are your friend not!
* Start from outside-in. Otherwise, it's easy to get lost in the HTML tags.

## Features
* Fully functioning website that takes into account accessibility and responsive design.
* Website is running on plain HTML/CSS, so no need to run any packages, just run a local server! (easily done with VS Code extensions)
* Design created from mobile view first, then desktop implemented.
